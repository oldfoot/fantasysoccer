The computer fonts Boomerand and 
Boomerang Italic were created by Harold Lohner, 
1998, and placed into the public domain by him.

They were based on analog reproductions of a 
pair of classic Art Nouveau fonts of the same name.

Check your key map for alternate non-descending 
characters in both fonts, and alternate caps in the italic.

Let me know what you do with these!
